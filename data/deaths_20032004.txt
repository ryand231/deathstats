Caveats:
"1. Totals and Percent of Total are disabled when data are grouped by a 113 or 130 Cause List because both aggregate and detailed"
"values are displayed in the table. Also be aware that charts and maps containing both aggregate and detail data could be"
"misleading."
"2. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
